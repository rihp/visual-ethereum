# visual-ethereum


This is a small project where we will be exploring the balances of the top Ethereum wallets, by using Google's BigQuery, and basic Python Tools such as `datetime`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

Also, the result of this project has been sent to **[dOrg](https://dOrg.tech)** (which stands for **d**escentralized **Org**anization) as an activation proposal to join the Decentralized Automated Organization (D.A.O.) as a freelance member.
